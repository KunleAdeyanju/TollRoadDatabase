# Toll Road Database
#### Class Project executed with partner

This code was originally the backend for a Java applet. The goal was to create a Highway auto-charge toll system. The app would enable users to:
* Start and end trips
* Calculate the tool fees
* Handle funds for transmitter accounts, auto-charge and replenish funds
* Create account reports
